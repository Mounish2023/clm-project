Plan: Contract Amendment Workflow - Multi-party negotiation
A party initiates the amendment to the Contract
I have an AI that helps me understand the amendment and how it impacts me vis-a-vis the other parties \ the other party policies might not be available to me
I understand the impact and now i initiate the amendment to the Contract
The other parties are notified and they can review the amendment
These other parties have their own AI Agent that analyzes the amendment and how it impacts them vis-a-vis the other parties
The other parties can accept or reject the amendment. If rejecting counter proposals can be made.
If the other parties accept the amendment, the amendment is accepted
The amendment is merged with the original contract and a new version is created
